**ABOUT ME**
  My name is Sam Goldberg. I am currently a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a double major B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and 
Computer Science with focusses in Bioinstrumentation, Artificial Intelligence/Deep Neural Networks, and Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCIs). 
I am currently studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark taking courses in Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Computational Analysis of Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence. 

  As a lifelong musician and engineer, I am passionate about technological innovation and human exploration. My current focus is on innovation geared toward longevity and artificial augmentations to the human body - including BCIs, wearable technologies, and prosthetics - and how these technologies will revolutionize medical, healthcare, entertainment, military defense, and space exploration industries over the coming decade.


I am looking to collaborate on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Backend Engineering projects to improve my skills in these areas.
