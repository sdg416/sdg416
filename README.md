**ABOUT ME**
  My name is Sam Goldberg. I am currently a Senior at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and a
Computer Science Minor with a focus on Bioinstrumentation and Machine Learning for Robotics and Brain-Computer Interfacing applications. 

  As a lifelong musician and engineer, I am passionate about technological innovation and human exploration. My current focus is on innovation geared toward longevity and artificial augmentations to the human body - including BCIs, wearable technologies, and prosthetics - and how these technologies will revolutionize medical, healthcare, entertainment, military defense, and space exploration industries over the coming decade.
